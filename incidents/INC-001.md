# INC-001 — High Latency Incident (FleetOps)

## Summary
FleetOps service experienced elevated latency where ~25% of requests exceeded 1 second.

## Timeline
- T0: Alert **HighLatency** fired
- T+2m: On-call acknowledged
- T+5m: Root cause identified
- T+7m: Service restarted
- T+10m: Metrics normalized

## Impact
- Users experienced slow responses
- No data loss

## Root Cause
Artificial latency injection (`sleep`) in request path without safeguards.

## Resolution
- Restarted service
- Reduced load during recovery

## Action Items
- Add latency SLO (p95 < 500ms)
- Add error-rate alert
- Add chaos toggle instead of random sleep
