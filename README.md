# 🚀 FleetOps – Production Incident Response Lab

This repository is a **working production-style lab**, not just a case study.

### What this project demonstrates
- A real running backend service (Python + Flask)
- Live metrics exposure using Prometheus
- Latency SLO monitoring and alerting
- Incident response using documented runbooks
- Post-incident analysis with written postmortems

### Architecture
- **Service:** Python Flask API
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus
- **Alerts:** Burn-rate style latency alert
- **Infra:** Docker + Docker Compose
  

## FleetOps — PE Incident Lab  
### Production Engineering case study: SLOs • burn-rate alerts • runbooks • capacity planning • postmortems • change safety

**What this repo shows:** how I would operate and harden a high-traffic service in production — with operational rigor.

**Notes:** Docs-first PE portfolio artifact: SLOs, runbooks, postmortems, change safety.

## Why this maps strongly to Meta Production Engineering
Meta PEs debug **live production** issues, define **SLOs**, enforce paging discipline, write runbooks to reduce MTTR, and plan capacity for peak traffic.

This repo demonstrates:
- **Reliability & performance**: SLOs, error budgets, burn-rate alerts  
- **Incident response**: triage → mitigation → validation → postmortem  
- **Capacity planning**: headroom, scaling triggers, burst modeling  
- **Change safety**: canary, rollback, risk controls

## System modeled

Clients
  ↓
API Gateway (routing, rate limiting, canary controls)

Feed Service —— Cache —— DB
  ↓
Observability (metrics + logs + traces)

Alerts → On-call → Runbook → Mitigation → Postmortem → Prevention


## Quick start (recruiter path)
1) `docs/02_slos_and_alerts.md`  
2) `docs/03_runbooks.md`  
3) `docs/06_postmortems/`  
4) `docs/08_change_management.md`

Tip: Start with SLOs → Runbooks → Postmortems to see incident handling end-to-end.
